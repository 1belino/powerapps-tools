# Center of Excellence Starter Kit
The Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit is a set of templates that are designed to help develop a strategy for adopting, maintaining and supporting the Power Platform, with a focus on Power Apps and Power Automate. The kit provides automation and tooling to help teams build monitoring and automation necessary to support a CoE.  The foundation of the kit is a Common Data Service (CDS) data model and workflows to collect resource information across the environments in the tenant (Sync flows).  The kit includes multiple Power Apps and Power BI analytics reports to view and interact with the data collected.  The kit also provides several assets that provide templates and suggested patterns and practices for implementing CoE efforts. The assets part of the CoE Starter Kit should be seen as a template from which you inherit your individual solution or can serve as inspiration for implementing your own apps and flows.

## Known Issues and Limitations
1. The CoE Starter Kit is currently not available in GCC environments, as the Flow Management connector is not available in this environment yet
2. Set New App Owner: the management connector action does not support setting new owners for SharePoint apps.
3. DLP Editor: Only returns the first 2000 environments and can not write back environment-type policies.
4. Admin Sync Template v2 Flows: The CDS connector might experience some throttling limits if the tenant has a lot of resources. If you see 429 errors in the Flow run history occurring in the later runs, you can configure a Retry Policy.
