# CoE Starter Kit - Invalid Argument Fix

Some users may get an **Invalid Argument** on trying to import the solution. This is due to a breaking change on the CDS side for pre-existing solutions on an older version that use Environment Variables. A fix is being rolled out and should be in all tenants in the next two weeks. 
In the meantime, if you are experiencing this issue, please import the solution file in this folder to your environment.
