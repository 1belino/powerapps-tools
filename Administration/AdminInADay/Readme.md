# Admin in a day
You've built several apps that save your organization time and money -- now, how do you support and manage all these apps? In this full-day workshop, learn best practices for management and governance of Power Apps and Microsoft Flow, including architecture overview, security considerations, licensing, monitoring, alerting, application lifecycle management, and educating app and report makers within IT and business units on best practices. Experience real-world demos, dive into the Power platform's admin capabilities, and learn how to build your own custom tools with Power Apps.

## Important Update
**Due to a recent change, tenants provisioned through demos.microsoft.com do not grant capacity for environments. The current setup scripts therefore do no longer work. We are working on an update.**
